Novena Logo
===========

Proposition for the Novena logo contest by Julien Deswaef  
http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=3777  

Novena, a crowd-funded fully open-hardware computing platform, creating a rupture with the common computer concepts available to the public, 
needs a logo that conveys this new approach. The logo has to reflect on the openess, the quality and the modularity offered by the project.  
The N in its dynamic and diamond shaped form shows a break from a previous trend and the rise of a new one.  
N is for new. N is open from bottom and top. N is for next. N is for novena.
