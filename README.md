Novena Logo
===========

Proposal for the [Novena logo contest](http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=3777) by Julien Deswaef

**Novena**, a crowd-funded open-hardware computing platform, creating a rupture with the common computer concept available to the public, needs a logo that conveys this new approach. The logo has to reflect on the openess, the quality and the modularity offered by the project.

The N in its dynamic and diamond shaped form shows a break from a previous trend and the rise of a new one.
N is for new. N is open from bottom and top. N is for next. N is for novena.

The typeface Montserrat regular by Julieta Ulanovsky − released under a SIL Open Font License − will be used to write the name "novena" (all lower case) when necessary.

This project is copyleft and published under the [Free Art License](http://artlibre.org/lal/en).

The license means you can use this logo for any purpose. And since Novena doesn't use it, I guess the first one to put it to good use wins. I promise to rename this project as soon as someone can prove me they use it. Submit an issue to claim your prize.
